GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

 Preamble

 The GNU Lesser General Public License is a free software license
 published by the Free Software Foundation.  It is intended to allow
 developers and companies to use and integrate software released under
 the LGPL into their own (possibly proprietary) software without
 being required to release the source code of their own components.

 The LGPL is similar to the GNU General Public License (GPL), but
 provides additional permissions for linking with non-(L)GPLed
 software.  This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, is
 designed to be used for certain software libraries.  The LGPL permits
 them to be linked with (and used by) non-free programs.

 TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 0. Definitions.

 "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public
 License.

 "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds
 of works, such as semiconductor masks.

 "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
 other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

 "You" means any person or entity that redistributes the Library under
 the terms of this License.

 "Source Code" means the preferred form of the work for making
 modifications to it.

 "Object Code" means any non-source form of a work.

 "Work that uses the Library" means either an application that is
 covered by the LGPL and uses the Library, or any other work in which
 the Library is embedded.

 "Combined Work" means a work produced by combining or linking an
 Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
 included in the Combined Work will be called the "Linked Library".

 "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
 Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
 for Components that are not derivative works of the Linked Library.

 "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the
 source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work)
 run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
 control those activities, but excluding the work's system libraries,
 and excluding general-purpose tools or generally available free
 programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
 which are not part of the work.

 The "Application" is any work that makes use of the Library but is not
 otherwise a derivative work of the Library.

 1. Exception to Section 3 of the GPL.

 You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that
 provide, in substance, that the recipient of the Combined Work may
 further convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under terms of the
 GNU General Public License version 3 (GPLv3).

 2. Basic permissions.

 All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
 copyright on the Library, and are irrevocable provided the stated
 conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
 permission to run the unmodified Library.  The output from running a
 covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
 content, constitutes a covered work.

 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

 No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
 measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, or
 similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
 measures.

 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

 You may convey verbatim copies of the Library's source code as you
 receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
 appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
 keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
 non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
 keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
 recipients a copy of this License along with the Library.

 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

 You may convey a modified version of the Library, provided that you
 also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
       stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
       charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If the modified library reads commands specified in a format
       designed to control users' interaction with it, you must ensure
       that these commands remain available for modification by the
       users.

 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

 You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
 sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
 Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and in one of
 the following ways:

    a) Convey the object code along with the Corresponding Source on a
       physical medium customarily used for software interchange; or

    b) Provide access to copy the object code from a designated place
       (preferably a network server) along with equivalent access to
       copy the Corresponding Source; or

    c) Offer, in a written offer, to provide the Corresponding Source
       on a physical medium for a charge no more than the cost of
       physically performing source distribution; or

    d) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
       you inform other peers where the Corresponding Source is being
       offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6b.

 7. Additional terms.

 Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you may add
 additional permissions to the terms of the Library, provided that any
 such additional permissions are themselves non-restrictive with
 respect to the rights conveyed by this License.

 8. Termination.

 You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
 provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
 modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
 this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
 paragraph of section 11).

 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

 You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
 run a copy of the Library.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
 occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
 to receive a copy does not require acceptance of this License.

 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

 Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
 receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
 propagate that work, subject to this License.

 11. Patents.

 Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
 patent license under their essential patent claims, to the extent
 necessary to make use of their contribution in the Library.

 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

 If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
 excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
 satisfy both this License and other obligations, you may not convey a
 covered work at all.

 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

 Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
 permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
 under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a
 single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.

 14. Revised Versions of the License.

 The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
 of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.  Each version
 is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library specifies
 that a certain numbered version of the LGPL "or any later version"
 applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
 conditions either of that published version or of any later version
 published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not
 specify a version number of the LGPL, you may choose any version ever
 published by the Free Software Foundation.

 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

 If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
 possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
 everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
 others to use it under this License.

 Include a copy of this License in the library's distribution.

 You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) to
 sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if necessary.  For
 more information on this, and how to apply and use the LGPL, see
 <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.
